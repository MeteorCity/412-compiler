# COMP412 Lab 2 – ILOC Compiler Allocator

## Building the Program

To build the program, run:
```bash
make build
```

This will compile all source files (main.cpp, scanner.cpp, parser.cpp, ir.cpp, renamer.cpp, allocator.cpp) and produce an executable named: 412fe

To clean up generated files, including object files and the executable, run:
```bash
make clean
```

## Running the Program

Invoke the program from the command line with the following command:
```bash
./412fe <flag> <input_file>
```

Where input_file is a file containing ILOC instructions to parse.

## Command-Line Options

The frontend supports the following command-line flags:

- `-h` — Display a help message describing how to run the program. No input file needed.
- `-x` — Scan, parse the file, perform renaming, and print the renaming result to stdout.
- `k` — Number of physical registers to allocate (`3 <= k <= 64`). Allocates registers and prints the allocated block to stdout.
