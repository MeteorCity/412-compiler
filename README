# COMP412 Lab 3 – ILOC Compiler Scheduler

## Building the Program

To build the program, run:
```bash
make build
```

This will compile all source files (main.cpp, scanner.cpp, parser.cpp, ir.cpp, renamer.cpp, scheduler.cpp, output.cpp) and produce an executable named: schedule

To clean up generated files, including object files and the executable, run:
```bash
make clean
```

## Running the Program

Invoke the program from the command line with the following command:
```bash
./schedule <flag> <input_file>
```

Where input_file is a file containing ILOC instructions to schedule.

## Command-Line Options

The frontend supports the following optional command-line flags:

- `-h` — Display a help message describing how to run the program. No input file needed.
- `-g` — Output a .dot file for dependency graph visualization
